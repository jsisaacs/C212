Early Evaluation Self-Assessment
--------------------------------

Question 1: [1]
Correct

Question 2: [0]
Wrong: 5 <= n <= 3, cannot simplify
Correct: n != 4
Explanation:
n      |    3       5
------------------------
n <= 3 | T T T F F F F F
n >= 5 | F F F F T T T T
------------------------
         1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
               ^
      n != 4 for this expression

Question 3: [1]
Correct

Question 4: [1]
Correct

Question 5: [1]
Correct

Question 6: [1]
Correct

Question 7: [1]
Correct

Question 8: [1]
Correct

Question 9: [0]
Wrong: true
Correct: b
Explanation:
b || false returns b, not true because the statement is saying b or false, so the
output is b because b is true.

Question 10: [0]
Wrong: if (n <= 5 && n < 20) {
            return true;
        }
Correct: if (n < 10)
              b = (n > 5)
            else if (true)
                   b = false;
                 else
                   b = (n < 20);
Explanation:
The correct solution is just a nested conditional, where the first condition is
whether or not n < 10.  b = (n > 5) if n < 10, so that means n is between 5 and 10.

Question 11: [0]
Wrong: if (n <= 5) {
            return true;
        }
Correct: b = (n > 5) && (b < 10);
Explanation:
The correct solution is true when n is 6, 7, 8, 9.  If n is anything else, the output
is false.

Question 12: [1]
Correct

Question 13: [1]
Correct

Question 14: [1]
Correct

Question 15: [1]
Correct

Question 16: [1]
Correct

Question 17: [1]
Correct

Question 18: [1]
Correct

Question 19: [0]
Wrong: 0
Correct: 7
Explanation:
This is because if 11 cannot go into 7 at all, the remainder that is left
is just 7.

Question 20: [0]
Wrong: 'B'
Correct: 2
Explanation:
'C' - 'A' = 2 because 'C' is at the position 3, and 'A' is at the position 1,
and 3 - 1 = 2.

Question 21: [1]
Correct

Question 22: [1]
Correct

Question 23: [1]
Correct

Question 24: [1]
Correct

Question 25: [1]
Correct

Question 26: [1]
Correct

Question 27: [1]
Correct

Question 28: [1]
Correct

Question 29: [1]
Correct

Question 30: [1]
Correct

Question 31: [1]
Correct

Question 32: [1]
Correct

Question 33: [1]
Correct

Question 34: [0]
Wrong: 20
Correct: infinite loop
Explanation:
The correct solution is infinite loop because setting i = i++ doesn't actually
change the value of i, so i stays at -10 and the for loop never terminates.

Question 35: [0]
Wrong: Yes, because no matter what val for x you use, if x != 8,
       it returns x = 5.
Correct: No, they handle 8 differently and have different outputs.
Explanation:
The reason why the two fragments are not equivalent is that the first one
turns 8 into 11 and everything else into 5.  The second turns 8 into 11 and
then into 5 and everything else into 5.

Question 36: [0]
Wrong: 1, n
Correct: none
Explanation:
There are zero instance variables.  Instance variables are instance specific
and are used by objects to store their states.

Question 37: [1]
Correct

Question 38: [1]
Correct

Question 39: [1]
Correct

Question 40: [1]
Correct

Question 41: [1]

Question 42: [1]

Question 43: [0]
Wrong: 0

       6
       7
       8
       9
Correct: infinite sequence of 0
Explanation:
The correct solution is just an infinite sequence of 0 because
the loop is infinite.  This is because count = count + 1 isn't
within the body of the loop.

Question 44: [1]
Correct
